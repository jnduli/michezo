# Introduction
Repo contains list of toy projects I make to learn something. Each
project should have a self detailed README on how to run it and how to
set it up. Once a project becomes mature enough I can move it from this
repo into an independent one.

This ensures that all my toy projects have a home, without necessarily
having to create a separate repo.
