# Mini search engine
Whenever I'm interested in some content, my first query is to usually
get the content from some company's engineering blog. However, searching
for this is usually tricky. This project aims to make a small search
engine that will regularly parse various select websites and return
content from them that I might be interested in.

This could also work as a point of sending notifications when someone
posts a blog from here.

# Design
- Maintain list of interesting websites in rss
- Regularly crawl these websites and index the content
- Have a search engine template website I can use for this.
